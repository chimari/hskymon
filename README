*** Introduction
This program (hskymon) is a telescope monitoring software for
SUBARU Telescope. It can be useful for actual observation and
also for obs preparation as a telescope simulator.
Basically, hskymon is optimized for SUBARU Telescope. However,
it can be adoped to other telescopes, changing positional parameters.

For target lists to display on the program, you can input OPE
files for SOSs or CSV text lists.

The latest version of hskymon is avairable on "HDS wiki"
    http://hds.skr.jp/wiki/  .
(But, you need to input password for this page.)  


*** Environment
hskymon requires UNIX operating system with X window system or
MS Windows (Win2000 or later).

To compile this program from its source code, you need to install
Gtk+ development tools (for Windows, I used MinGW + Gtk-dev).
Gtk+2.8 (or later) is required (my recommendation is ver2.10 or later).

In order to get telescope status, hskymon requires xmlrpc-c library.
But, Windows version does not support this function.
You need to install some libraries and develope environment for them
to make this program.
(gtk+2-dev, xmlrpc-c3-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev ... etc.)



*** Build from the source code
  - Enter the archive directory.

  - % ./configure  (--with-xmlrpc : to get telescope status)

  - % make

Then, an excutable file "hskymon" will be created.

  - # make install  
   (or you can copy "hskymon" file to an appropriate directory.)
 



*** Build from the source code (Windows ver.)
Basicall, Windows version of hskymon is distributed as a binary
package with Gtk+ libraries.

If you use msys + min-gw + gtk-dev,

  - % ./configure --with-win32
 
  - % make
  (or makewin32.sh)


*** Command line option
     -h, --help                    : Print help message
     -i, --input [input-file]      : Set the inpout CSV list file
     -a, --witht-allsky            : Switch on All Sky Camera
     -nt, --without-telstat        : Switch off to read Telescope Status
     -s, --server [server-address] : Override Telstat Server
     -l, --log [log-file]          : Output log file


*** Input files
[1]OPE file
OPE files for SOSs can be avairable for inputs.
hskymon reads the parameter list section in OPE files likely,

   <PARAMETER_LIST>

   TGT_BD44493=OBJECT="BD+44 493" RA=022649.60 DEC=+445746.80 EQUINOX=2000.00
   TGT_HD222304=OBJECT="HD222304" RA=033908.30 DEC=+502818.20 EQUINOX=2000.00
   TGT_HD224544=OBJECT="HD224544" RA=235849.20 DEC=+322254.10 EQUINOX=2000.00
   TGT_HD225132=OBJECT="HD225132" RA=000344.40 DEC=-172009.50 EQUINOX=2000.00
           ....................................

All characters in the objectname will be capitalized.

.prm files in which standard stars are defined are also loaded
automatically.
You should write command to load *.prm files likely

*LOAD "hogehoge.prm"

in the <PARAMETER> field of OPE files.
# double quatation is required for the file name.
Current searching paths for *.prm files are
  1.  same directory with the loaded *.ope
  2.  subdirectory "COMMON/"
  3.  same level directory "../COMMON/"
  4.  "~/Procedure/"
  5.  "~/Procedure/<INST>/"
  6.  "~/Procedure/<INST>/COMMON/"
  7.  "~/Procedure/COMMON/"


As default, hskymon displays all objects defined in the loaded OPE file.
If you want to hide unused objects (in "GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or 
"SetupField*" commands in <COMMAND> field of the OPE file),
you can hide them with "Hide Objects unused in OPE file" button
(the 2nd button in ASC/Telstat menu). 

For .prm files, the ojects are loaded only in the case that it is used
in commands ("GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or "SetupField*") in the OPE
file.


[2]CSV Text file
The following fromat text files are also avairable for data inputs.

	HD94028     ,105128.1 ,+201639.0 ,2000,  <comments>
	BD+36 2165  ,111248.0 ,+354343.9 ,2000,  Mv=8.4  Fe/H=-2
	HD97916     ,111554.2 ,+020512.1 ,2000,  Mv=10.2 Fe/H=-2
