*** Introduction
This program (hskymon) is a telescope monitoring software for
SUBARU Telescope. It can be useful for actual observation and
also for obs preparation as a telescope simulator.
Basically, hskymon is optimized for SUBARU Telescope. However,
it can be adoped to other telescopes, changing positional parameters.

For target lists to display on the program, you can input OPE
files for SOSs or CSV text lists.

The latest version (souce code and Win/Mac binary packages) can be 
found in GitHub.
  https://github.com/chimari/hskymon
If you want to make a clone of the latest source code, use
  git clone https://github.com/chimari/hskymon.git
in your terminal.


*** Environment
hskymon requires UNIX operating system with X window system,
MS Windows (Win2000 or later), or MacOS (Mavericks or later).

To compile this program from its source code, you need to install
Gtk+ development tools (for Windows, I use msys + Gtk-dev).
Gtk+2.8 (or later) is required (my recommendation is ver2.10 or later).
libxml2 and openssl is also required to build the program.

In order to get telescope status, hskymon requires xmlrpc-c library.
But, Windows/Mac version does not support this function.
You need to install some libraries and develope environment for them
to make this program.
(gtk+2-dev, xmlrpc-c3-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev ... etc.)



*** Build from the source code
  - Enter the archive directory.

  - (only when you cloned the source tree by git)
    % touch configure configure.ac aclocal.m4 Makefile.am Makefile.in

  - % ./configure  (--with-xmlrpc : to get telescope status)
         (If you failed to make due to aclocal error,
          Please try  ./autogen.sh  )

  - % make

Then, an excutable file "hskymon" will be created.

  - # make install  
   (or you can copy "hskymon" file to an appropriate directory.)
 



*** Build from the source code (Windows ver.)
Basicall, Windows version of hskymon is distributed as a binary
package with Gtk+ libraries.

If you use msys + min-gw + gtk-dev,

  - % ./configure --with-win32
 
  - % make
  (or makewin32.sh)


*** Command line option
     -h, --help                    : Print help message
     -i, --input [input-file]      : Set the inpout CSV list file
     -a, --witht-allsky            : Switch on All Sky Camera
     -nt, --without-telstat        : Switch off to read Telescope Status
     -s, --server [server-address] : Override Telstat Server
     -l, --log [log-file]          : Output log file


*** Input files
[1]OPE file
OPE files for SOSs can be avairable for objects inputs.
hskymon reads the parameter list section in OPE files likely,

   <PARAMETER_LIST>

   TGT_BD44493=OBJECT="BD+44 493" RA=022649.60 DEC=+445746.80 EQUINOX=2000.00
   TGT_HD222304=OBJECT="HD222304" RA=033908.30 DEC=+502818.20 EQUINOX=2000.00
   TGT_HD224544=OBJECT="HD224544" RA=235849.20 DEC=+322254.10 EQUINOX=2000.00
   TGT_HD225132=OBJECT="HD225132" RA=000344.40 DEC=-172009.50 EQUINOX=2000.00
           ....................................

All characters in the objectname will be capitalized.

.prm files in which standard stars are defined are also loaded
automatically.
You should write command to load *.prm files likely

*LOAD "hogehoge.prm"

in the <PARAMETER> field of OPE files.
# double quatation is required for the file name.
Current searching paths for *.prm files are
  1.  same directory with the loaded *.ope
  2.  subdirectory "COMMON/"
  3.  same level directory "../COMMON/"
  4.  "~/Procedure/"
  5.  "~/Procedure/<INST>/"
  6.  "~/Procedure/<INST>/COMMON/"
  7.  "~/Procedure/COMMON/"


As default, hskymon displays all objects defined in the loaded OPE file.
If you want to hide unused objects (in "GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or 
"SetupField*" commands in <COMMAND> field of the OPE file),
you can hide them with "Hide Objects unused in OPE file" button
(the 2nd button in ASC/Telstat menu). 

For .prm files, the ojects are loaded only in the case that it is used
in commands ("GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or "SetupField*") in the OPE
file.


[2]CSV Text file
The text files written in the following CSV format are also avairable for
objects inputs.

	HD94028     ,105128.1 ,+201639.0 ,2000,  <comments>
	BD+36 2165  ,111248.0 ,+354343.9 ,2000,  Mv=8.4  Fe/H=-2
	HD97916     ,111554.2 ,+020512.1 ,2000,  Mv=10.2 Fe/H=-2
	BD+51 1696  ,114635.2 ,+505254.7 ,2000   
	BD-13 3442  ,114650.7 ,-140643.5 ,2000,
