Description: SKy-Monitor for Subaru Telescope, NAOJ.
 During actual observation hskymon works as a sky and telescope monitor.
 Furthermore, it can be used as a visibility checker, a finding charts 
 creator, and a guiding stars finder during obs preparation in your environment.
 Basically, hskymon is optimized for Subaru Telescope. However,
 it can be adopted to other telescopes, changing positional parameters.
