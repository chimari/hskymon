	              gray image, because there are no pairs to subtract.)
	              These are kept in main memory (MAX 20 images).
	              So, the total spend of the main memory increases
	              in this version (30MB -> 50MB in average w/ ASIVA Mid-IR

	                  Open a dialog to change display parameters
	              To see differential images, Check "Show Diff. Images"
	              in the menu.
	              Some parameters creating differential images can be
	              changed in a dialog.
	            - Added display parameters to show all sky images
	              (screen & saturation factor), which can be changed
	              in a pop-up window.
	            - Limit pixbuf size of All-Sky image for ASIVA [Visual].
	              (= 800x800 pix) to save main memory, using
	              gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size .
	            - Fix a collision of draw_skymon_cairo between parent &
	              child processes (Windows ver.).

                      using XMLRPC (method "get_ope_paths" via "integgui0").
                      Use a menu button "File -> Sync OPE w/IntegGUI".
                    - If TelStat is running (w/XMLRPC), "Open OPE" is now
	              trying to find the directory where the latest OPE file is

2010.9.24   ver2.3.10 - Added the loading function for *.prm files (standard
	                stars' definition etc.).
	                *.prm files listed (*LOAD) in OPE files are loaded
	                automatically
                        If such objects defined in .prm files are not used
	                in "GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or "SetupField*"
	                commands in the OPE file, they will not appear
	                in Object List of hskymon.
                        Current searching path for *.prm file
	                  1.  same directory with the loaded *.ope
	                  2.  subdirectory "COMMON/"
	                  3.  same level directory "../COMMON/"
	                  4.  "~/Procedure/"
	                  5.  "~/Procedure/COMMON/"
	                If you want to list up all objects included in
	                a *.prm file, you should use "File" -> "Merge PRM"
	                from the menu bar.
	              - Added a function to hide unused objects in the
	                loaded OPE file ("GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or
	                "SetupField*" commands in <COMMAND> field).
	                 --> The 2nd button in "ASC/Telstat".
                      - Changing the main window title according to the
	                loaded OPE/List file.

2010.8.3    ver2.3.9  - Changed the default DSS server for finding charts
	                to "SkyView" at NASA.
	                (It has a flexibility to change image size and
	                scale. It's good for smooth downloading.)
	                Added 2MASS images for finding charts via SkyView.

2010.6.28   ver2.3.8  - Added "multiple objects plot" function for elevation
	                plot window.
	              - Refurbished the procedure for spinner widgets.
	                  use gtk_adjustment_set_value
	                  instead of gtk_entry_set_text

2010.6.21   ver2.3.7  - Changed how to parse OPE.
	                Now, the order of "RA=", "DEC=", EQUINOX=" and
	                "OBJECT=" must be voluntary.
	                For each line in the parameter_list section of ope files,
	                  [1] search "=" first
	                  [2] Then, for the rest of the line,
	                      just search "OBJECT=", "RA=" etc.
	                  [3] Then, check the previous character of each
	                      argument definition (it must be " " or "=").
	              - Added a tag to display the time difference between
	                the all sky image and the current time.

2010.6.15   ver2.3.6  - Added toggle switch for each object in Object List
	                to switch on/off displaying them in the sky monitor.
                      - In OPE file parsing,
	                search " RA=", " DEC=" & " EQUINOX=" instead of
	                "RA=", "DEC=" & "EQUINOX=" (added a space).
	                So, each objects must be defined as
	                 TGT_OBJ=OBJECT="Name" RA=hhmmss.s DEC=+ddmmss.s ...

2010.6.10   ver2.3.5  - Bug fix for OPE file parsing.
	                (for parameter lines including "RA=" w/o "OBJECT=")

2010.5.27   ver2.3.4  - The default telstat server has been changed
	                (ssdd1 -> g2stat).
	              - Added a command line option to appoint the telstat
	                server host.
	                Use "-s <server-address>" option.
	              - Added timeout canceling procedure for allsky image
	                fetching process (90sec).
	              - Added IRCS FOV for finding chart.
	              - Bug fix on "-a" (--with-allsky) option.

2010.5.19   ver2.3.3  - Added logging mode.
	                Use "-l <log-file>" option.
	              - Removed some stdout outputs from calcpa.c .

2010.3.25   ver2.3.2  - Bug fix on the function of making finding charts
	                with SDSS (for dec<0).
	              - Added "fflush(stderr)" just before issuing SIGUSR2
                        in the child thread.

2010.3.24   ver2.3.1  - Small bug fixes on the termination of the fetching
	                process for the UH all sky camera image.

2010.3.18   ver2.3.0  - Added "finding chart" function to make finding charts
	                for targets in the object list from DSS or SDSS images.

                      - The process to access to the "UH All-Sky Camera"
	                has been changed into a multi-threaded background
	                task not to disturb the main task of the sky monitor.

	              - Changed the permission of temporary files
	                (/tmp/*). Now all temporary files have "666" for
	                their permission (over-writable for all users).

	              - Added the moon plot function in the objects'
	                elevation plot.

2009.11.18  ver2.2.2  - Added "SkyCheck" function which keep last 20 shots
	                of the all sky camera and show animation (in Mode tab)

                      - Showing the telescope route estimation during its
	                slewing time.

                      - Added the Azimuth indicator for TelStat.


2009.6.13   ver2.1.0  - "Telstat" function to access a Gen2 status server
	                to get the telescope status (using xmlrpc-c).

	              - The 1st release for Gen2.
