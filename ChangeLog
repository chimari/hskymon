	              Preset combo and Set button are added in Properties
	              window to switch UH88 <---> ASIVA camera.

	              This mode automatically calculate the current PA of HDS
	              SV and rotate the FC image.

2010.11.22  ver2.3.11 - Added sun and planets plot the in sky monitor.
	              - Added "UT" at the top left corner.

2010.9.24   ver2.3.10 - Added the loading function for *.prm files (standard
	                stars' definition etc.).
	                *.prm files listed (*LOAD) in OPE files are loaded
	                automatically
                        If such objects defined in .prm files are not used
	                in "GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or "SetupField*"
	                commands in the OPE file, they will not appear
	                in Object List of hskymon.
                        Current searching path for *.prm file
	                  1.  same directory with the loaded *.ope
	                  2.  subdirectory "COMMON/"
	                  3.  same level directory "../COMMON/"
	                  4.  "~/Procedure/"
	                  5.  "~/Procedure/COMMON/"
	                If you want to list up all objects included in
	                a *.prm file, you should use "File" -> "Merge PRM"
	                from the menu bar.
	              - Added a function to hide unused objects in the
	                loaded OPE file ("GetObject*", "GetStandard*" or
	                "SetupField*" commands in <COMMAND> field).
	                 --> The 2nd button in "ASC/Telstat".
                      - Changing the main window title according to the
	                loaded OPE/List file.

2010.8.3    ver2.3.9  - Changed the default DSS server for finding charts
	                to "SkyView" at NASA.
	                (It has a flexibility to change image size and
	                scale. It's good for smooth downloading.)
	                Added 2MASS images for dinding charts via SkyView.

2010.6.28   ver2.3.8  - Added "oulti objects plot" function for elevation
	                plot window.
	              - Refurbished the procedure for spinner widgets.
	                  use gtk_adjustment_set_value
	                  instead of gtk_entry_set_text

2010.6.21   ver2.3.7  - Changed how to parse OPE.
	                Now, the order of "RA=", "DEC=", EQUINOX=" and
	                "OBJECT=" must be voluntary.
	                For each line in the prarameter_list section of ope files,
	                  [1] sarch "=" first
	                  [2] Then, for the rest of the line,
	                      just search "OBJECT=", "RA=" etc.
	                  [3] Then, check the previous character of each
	                      argument definition (it must be " " or "=").
	              - Added a tag to display the time difference between
	                the all sky image and the current time.

2010.6.15   ver2.3.6  - Added toggle switch for each object in Object List
	                to switch on/off displaying them in the sky monitor.
                      - In OPE file parsing,
	                search " RA=", " DEC=" & " EQUINOX=" instead of
	                "RA=", "DEC=" & "EQUINOX=" (added a space).
	                So, each objects must be defined as
	                 TGT_OBJ=OBJECT="Name" RA=hhmmss.s DEC=+ddmmss.s ...

2010.6.10   ver2.3.5  - Bug fix for OPE file parsing.
	                (for parameter lines including "RA=" w/o "OBJECT=")

2010.5.27   ver2.3.4  - The default telstat server has been changed
	                (ssdd1 -> g2stat).
	              - Added a command line option to appoint the telstat
	                server host.
	                Use "-s <server-address>" option.
	              - Added timeout canceling procedure for allsky image
	                fetching process (90sec).
	              - Added IRCS FOV for finding chart.
	              - Bug fix on "-a" (--with-allsky) option.

2010.5.19   ver2.3.3  - Added logging mode.
	                Use "-l <log-file>" option.
	              - Removed some stdout outputs from calcpa.c .

2010.3.25   ver2.3.2  - Bug fix on the function of making finding charts
	                with SDSS (for dec<0).
	              - Added "fflush(stderr)" just before issueing SIGUSR2
                        in the child thred.

2010.3.24   ver2.3.1  - Small bug fixes on the termination of the fetching
	                process for the UH all sky camera image.

2010.3.18   ver2.3.0  - Added "finding chart" function to make finding charts
	                for targets in the object list from DSS or SDSS images.

                      - The process to access to the "UH All-Sky Camera"
	                has been changed into a multi-threaded background
	                task not to disturb the main task of the sky monitor.

	              - Changed the permission of temporary files
	                (/tmp/*). Now all temporary files have "666" for
	                their permission (over-writable for all users).

	              - Added the moon plot function in the objects'
	                elevation plot.

2009.11.18  ver2.2.2  - Added "SkyCheck" function which keep last 20 shots
	                of the all sky camera and show animation (in Mode tab)

                      - Showing the telescope route estimation during its
	                slewing time.

                      - Added the Azimuth indicator for telestat.


2009.6.13   ver2.1.0  - "Telstat" function to access a Gen2 satus server
	                to get the telescope status (using xmlrpc-c).

	              - The 1st release for Gen2.
